# Mask üò∑

This project is a playground to learn gRPC. This repo contain 2 services which is used by the [graphie repo](https://github.com/shigedangao/graphie) to expose French's covid data.

# Data uses

Data comes from the website [data.gouv.fr](https://data.gouv.fr/). I also used data from the [etalab repository](https://github.com/etalab/data-covid19-dashboard-widgets). Below is the current dataset which is exposed by these gRPC services:

## Hospital services

- [Hospital cases by age by region (donnees-hospitalieres-classe-age-covid19-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/08c18e08-6780-452d-9b8c-ae244ad529b3)
- [Hospital new case (donnees-hospitalieres-nouveaux-covid19-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/6fadff46-9efd-4c53-942a-54aca783c30c)
- [Mix betweeen SI-VIC, SI-DEP & VAC-SI ‚ö†Ô∏è this dataset is not regularly updated...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etalab/data-covid19-dashboard-widgets/master/files_new/vacsi_non_vacsi_nat.csv)
- [Entry in ICU for unvax people / 1M](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etalab/data-covid19-dashboard-widgets/master/dist/sc_non_vacsi.json)
- [Entry in ICU for vax people / 1M](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etalab/data-covid19-dashboard-widgets/master/dist/sc_vacsi.json)
- [Hospital data per department (donnees-hospitalieres-covid19-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/63352e38-d353-4b54-bfd1-f1b3ee1cabd7)

## PCR services

- [Positive pcr test by department (sp-pos-quot-dep-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/406c6a23-e283-4300-9484-54e78c8ae675)
- [Positive pcr test by region (sp-pos-quot-reg-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/001aca18-df6a-45c8-89e6-f82d689e6c01)
- [Positive pcr test in the whole country (sp-pos-quot-fra-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/dd0de5d9-b5a5-4503-930a-7b08dc0adc7c)
- [Incidences cases per department for 100k daily (sp-pe-std-quot-dep-<date>)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/4180a181-a648-402b-92e4-f7574647afa6)

# Contributing

## Getting started

### Docker

For docker user. You only need to generate TLS key by using the `generate.sh` script. See the [section](#tls-certificate). Once done you can use podman or docker-compose to bootstrap the project ```docker-compose up -d```

### Manual installation

In the manual installation. You are required to have:

- Postgres
- Rust
- Python3

1. You may create a file named `config.toml` from the `config.toml.dist` file. Fill the `config.toml` with your local postgres installation. 
2. Import the data by running the command `python3 ./import.py`
3. Check the TLS certificate section and then generate a set of TLS certificate with the command `./generator.sh`. The script will ask you to prompt password to generate these certificates
4. You should be done. Go to one of the microservice folder either hospital or pcr and you may run the command ```cargo run```

# Misc info

## Healthcheck

These project run in a Kubernetes cluster. As a result we need to configure a healthcheck for the pods. To do that we uses [grpc-health-probe](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe). Below is a command which shows how we do the healthcheck. :warning: the gRPC healthcheck is currently in alpha stage. We may switch to the native gRPC healthcheck when available in beta or in ga.

```bash
./grpc_health_probe -addr=127.0.0.1:5601 -service=healthcheck.HealthService
```

## Test gRPC server with bloom rpc

To test the gRPC server. It's recommended to use [bloom rpc](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc). Because we're running in secure mode. You may refer to the configuration below for the TLS configuration of bloomrpc

## Unit test

Each services have unit tests. These tests doesn't really test the gRPC server. But it more or less test the async function inside such as database query, simulate rpc input & output
